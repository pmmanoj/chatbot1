# chatbot1

[ Feb. 8 2018 ] 
  This is is a STAGING directory; which means code here is WAD 
  Working-As-Designed and in-use by outside testing groups 

  This is NOT-A-DEMO directory or repo. We may use this to demo
  to informal audiences; but there is NO committment to maintain
  PRODUCTION Service Delivery levels. In other words, this repo 
  or its code may not be in running conditions -- occassionally. 

  Almost 99% of the time, code is available for use. 

  Our naming convention is as follows: 
 
  chatbot0 : is the DEVELOPMENT code master branch; individual 
             developers will copy the master branch to their 
             own namespace for development.

  chatbot1 : < this repo > is STAGING code master branch; individual 
             developers may clone this repo; but CANNOT commit to this 
             repo

  chatbot2 : is the PRODUCTION repo code master branch; restricted repo; 
             only particular persons can upload into this repository; 
             and code here should be used for DEMO purposes
